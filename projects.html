            This course combines the study of user experience (UX) design 
            with an immersive travel experience in Poland, focusing on how 
            design can be informed by and respond to trauma, especially 
            historical war related trauma. Through visits to significant sites, 
            interactions with local communities, and hands-on design project 
            for a refugee center, students will learn to create UX solutions 
            that are sensitive to traumatic experiences and promote healing and 
            resilience.

              This capstone course focused on the development of an innovative platform, 
              WEL, for a private client, under a strict Non-Disclosure Agreement. 
              Across two semesters, my team and I employed technologies such as Angular, 
              TypeScript, and Bulma for front-end development, complemented by AWS, Java Spring Boot, 
              and PostgreSQL for the back-end. My role concentrated on enhancing the user experience 
              through designing low and high-fidelity prototypes, conducting user interviews, and creating 
              detailed user personas. This experience deepened my technical skills and understanding 
              of user-centered design, equipping me to effectively address complex design challenges.

            to create wireframes. We focused on various design fidelities and conducted 
            extensive user research to ensure our application met user needs effectively. 
            Throughout the project, we applied Nielsen Norman Group best practices to 
            refine our design approach. Additionally, we emphasized accessibility by 
            adhering to WCAG contrast standards and carefully selected font faces and 
            color schemes using Paletton. This project provided a practical, hands-on experience
